<summary><b>"Who are you?"</b> 💬</summary><br>

🎙️ I started my IT career in 2021 through the Up!Tech program, Riachuelo's career accelerator, where I was selected among several candidates for an intensive 3-month immersion in systems development. My performance led to my hiring by Banco Midway, and since then I have been specializing in building systems, always focusing on applying best practices to ensure code that is readable, efficient, and easy to maintain.

🎙️ Banco Midway | Open Finance Squad

- Developed and integrated RESTful microservices using PostgreSQL and AWS, meeting the requirements of Open Banking Phase 1 established by BACEN (Brazilian Central Bank).

- Collaborated in creating a proof of concept (PoC) project for the developers' portal, automating Swagger uploads to AWS S3.

- Implemented unit and integration tests, ensuring the robustness of critical functionalities such as PIX payments.

🎙️ Ília | Client: Mio Vinci Partners

- Contributed to the evolution and maintenance of RESTful microservices in the private pension context, using Spring Boot with Hibernate/JPA and integrations with AWS services such as DynamoDB, SQS, and S3.

- Implemented features such as automatic email triggering via SQS, enhanced security with Captcha on authentication endpoints, optimized APIs for displaying plans in the app, and calculated minimum contributions. Also fixed bugs in sensitive endpoints related to portability and balance visualization, among other activities.

- Authored around 35 articles on the corporate wiki covering topics such as best practices (code and branch naming conventions; commit standards; logging patterns; Checkstyle; RESTful APIs), tools (AWS DynamoDB, SQS), and private pension domain knowledge (PGBL/VGBL, tax regimes), with a focus on clear documentation and practical application for development teams.

- Invited by the CTO, Corporate Architect, and Tech Manager to lead technical meetings for three months, where I shared clean code practices, suggested improvements to internal workflows, and led process standardization initiatives. Among the results, I highlight the proposal to create specific tasks for functionality validation in the development (DEV) environment before moving to the next stage, which significantly reduced the incidence of bugs and was recognized by the QA team, who reported a considerable decrease in rework.
