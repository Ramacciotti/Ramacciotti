<summary><b>"Who are you?"</b> 💬</summary><br>     

🎙️ My name is Mariana Ramacciotti and I live in São Paulo - Brazil. I'm a Junior Systems Analyst at Midway (from the Riachuelo group), and I work as a fullstack Web!

<!-- Pergunta 1.A ---------------------------------------------->

<summary><b>"Fullstack? What is it?"</b> 💬</summary><br>     

🎙️ I´s the professional who has two basic skills for development: front-end and back-end. Long story short, I work with websites: with the part that the user sees (frontend), and also with the parts that the user doesn´t see (backend)!

<summary><b>"I heard you say something about Up!Tech. Can you tell me more about this?"</b> 💬</summary><br> 

🎙️ Ah, yes! This achievement took place in May 2021, when I passed the selection process for Up!Tech, Riachuelo's program to accelerate professional careers in technology. 😊 

🎙️ The pilot class, in which I participated, had only 20 spots for more than 3000 entries. On the full stack track, which was the one I took, they provided live training, practical activities and access to virtual content from the Riachuelo University portfolio and the Alura platform. 
  
🎙️ I even advertised the program on Riachuelo's Linkedin page, if you want to take a look: https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6871891453564526592/
