## Welcome! 

ðŸš€ I started my career in the IT area as a Systems Analyst in June 2021, when I was selected for the first class of Up!Tech: career acceleration program. Since then, my focus has been on developing systems with quality and performance, using good practices and design patterns to achieve greater readability and facilitate code maintenance.

ðŸ’µ During these years, I actively contributed to the implementation of phases 1 and 2 of Open Finance at Midway. In phase 1, I was responsible for creating APIs to store non-sensitive data from institutions, loans and credit cards in PostgreSQL. In phase 2, I focused on developing APIs to store and transmit customer and account registration data using AWS DynamoDB. Additionally, I also worked on integrating APIs and ensuring communication efficiency between different microservices.

ðŸ’¼ One of the most interesting points in my career as a developer was the creation of unit/integration tests for the PIX payment flow API through Open Finance, which strengthened my Java skills. I was also responsible for creating the company's Developer Portal POC, allowing Swagger to upload other teams' APIs to Amazon S3. Sonar Cloud, Rancher and Azure DevOps are other tools I also work with.
