## Welcome! 

ðŸ’» I started my career in the IT as a Systems Analyst in June 2021, when I was selected for the first class of Up!Tech: Riachuelo's career program. Since then, my focus has been to develop systems with quality and performance, using good practices and design patterns to obtain greater readability and facilitate code maintenance.

ðŸŽ“ In October 2022, I started an MBA in Software Architecture and Solutions; learning to implement high-performance architectures considering significant aspects such as functionality, performance, resiliency, reusability, understanding, scalability, security, technology constraints and trade-offs.

ðŸ‘“ I appreciate constantly learning; sharing, collaborating, innovating and delivering value to the company. My experience includes:

* Develop API's Crud Restfull;
* Perform data modeling in relational banks;
* Create login and registration systems with Amazon Cognito;
* Integrate projects with Amazon S3 buckets;
* Create services according to business rules;
* Develop new features and implement fixes;
* Run tests to ensure software quality;
* Participate in the rites of agile methodology, being part of multifunctional teams;
